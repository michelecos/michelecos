Hello, welcome to my home on Github.

I am a seasoned developer. I started in C in 1982 working on the Olivetti line of unix servers.

We made the hardware and built the drivers and the kernel starting from BSD Unix.

My contributions have been rewriting and rehosting the runtime support system for a COBOL compiler. I created also a few device drivers and an extended kernel debugger. A toy project was a tool for sharing a tty between a local user and a remote maintenance technician.
